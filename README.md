# adobe-activation-hosts

For use with AdGuardHome, PiHole, or ``/etc/hosts``. Or even ``C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts``, if you roll that way.

Updated somewhat frequently from https://helpx.adobe.com/de/enterprise/kb/network-endpoints.html

# Usage

Add ``https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ephidrineon/adobe-activation-hosts/main/hosts`` to your filter lists in your DNS resolver for the "bleeding edge" experience. Or copy the rules and add them to your hosts file. You know what you're doing. I trust in you.
